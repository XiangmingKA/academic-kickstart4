# Overview
This is a third-person car racing game developed with Unreal.
I am fully responsible for all the blueprint programming and part of the scene-setting in Corporate Cooperation Course at UESTC in 2019.


# Features

## Scene

The scene of this game is a race track in a desert. We set up several swerves with different angles to test players' skills.

## UI

I added a basic UI in this game, showing the current speed of the car. And there is an End text in the beginning and the ending of the game showing player's time of passing the game.

## Game manipulation

By pressing W A S D, players can speed up or brake the car and turn left/right.
