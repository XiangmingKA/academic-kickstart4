# Overview
This is a third-person multiplayer tank shooting game developed with Unity 3D.
I am fully responsible for all the game development and design as the course project in Game Engine Architecture at UESTC in 2018.

It showcased my abilities to:
1. C# Programming for Unity 3D.
2. Set up the terrain, vegetation, and scenes in Unity 3D.
3. Multiplayer game model programming.
4. Complex modeling.

This project was completed when I was a sophomore. I can do much better now;)

# Features
## Game scenes

The scene of this game is based on the campus of UESTC. And the building models were created by me in another course: Advanced Modeling Technology.

## Level design

While the game design wasn't the focus area of this project, I implemented a simple multiplayer level design: Two players are born at spawn point A & B and begin to fight!

## Game mechanisms

At the beginning of this game, players will be shown in the following scene. Players can choose to host a new game or join others' games by entering the local host number.

Players can move and rotate their tanks by pressing W A S D. And there is a pointer at the top of the scene indicating player's health value.

By entering "space", they can fire a shell. The field of fire depends on the time players pressing "space" demonstrated as following:
