# My responsibility:
I was responsible for the shader creations in Unity's 2D Lighting system. To create the color blindness effects, I changed the lighting model to convert color information to grayscale. And I built a user-friendly shader GUI for artists, which is easy to debug between normal colored mode and the grayscale mode. 
I created the 2D lighting environment and the particles in the game, assisted artists in their texture and animation creations.
Also, I was responsible for part of the gameplay programming.
