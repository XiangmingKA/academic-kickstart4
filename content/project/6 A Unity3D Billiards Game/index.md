# Overview
This is a third-person multiplayer tank shooting game developed with Unity 3D.
I am fully responsible for all the game development and design as the course project in Game Engine Architecture at UESTC in 2018.

This project was completed when I was a sophomore. I can do much better now;)

# Features

## Scene

The scene of this game is a classic pool table, with a spotlight constantly fall on the white ball.

## UI

I added a basic UI in this game, showing the current player name and his/her score. At the bottom of the scene, there is a pointer showing the strength of batting.

## Game manipulation

Players can control the club to rotate towards up, down, right, and left by pressing WASD.
By pressing "space", players can accumulate the strength of batting.
