# Overview
This is a Monte-Carlo rendering system that supports global illumination, interpolating parameters, texture mapping, bounding volume hierarchy accelerating, and depth of field effected rendering, etc..<br>
I independently accomplished it under the guidance of Prof. Pradeep Sen. <br>

The main workflow of the program is as follows: <br>
1. Implement a basic Whitted-style ray tracer. <br>
2. Improved it to support interpolating parameters, texture mapping, shaders.<br>
3. Accelerate the rendering of complex scenes by optimize the sphere and triangle intersection routines and add acceleration data structures.
4. Improve it to support Monte-Carlo integration (pixel antialiasing by integrating with a box filter over the pixel footprint and depth of field by integrating over the aperture of the camera).
5. Add path tracing to support global illumination.

# Features
## Ray Tracing

The first step of this system is to implement a basic Whitted-style ray tracer. Features like reflection, refraction, and shadowing are supported.

Then, I Improved it to support more shaders, such as texture mapping and interpolating parameters.

To render complex scenes, I added a heuristic bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) to store the primitives in an efficient manner. Also, I optimize the sphere and triangle intersection routines. In most scenes, the speed of rendering has been accelerated by more than 50x.

A complex scene rendered within 2 minutes:

Now, it is the time to implement path tracing!

## Monte-Carlo integration & Path Tracing

To support pixel antialiasing, I implemented a box filter over the pixel footprint and depth of field by integrating over the aperture of the camera illustrated as follows:

As for the depth-of-field effect, I simulated an imaginary thin lens with a fixed aperture to produce a nice depth-of-field effect, where some objects will be sharp but others blurry.

Original scene:

Depth-of-field effected scene:

Now, here is the most important part! 
A basic Monte-Carlo estimater was implemented to sample radiance of the hemisphere.

By integrating the radiance coming from the hemisphere, we could estimate the radiance of indirect illumination. So far, we can get the global illuminated scenes as follows.

## Final thesis

Also, I added a basic volumetic scattering effect estimater in this path tracer and wrote a final paper in SIGGRAPH tamplate which discussed principles of volumetic rendering and path tracing.
